I also started to feel unwell that day, but luckily I was able to pull through. I can’t say the same though for the weekends, as at the time of writing this, hoooboy I am ridden with coughs and sniffles and a sore body. It hasn’t really been a super duper fun week because of the sickness, but oh well. Looking forward to next week! (2 tests :’c)"

It follows my other passion (and major), theatre and specifically, acting. This passion really came to fruition at the end of my high school years when I discovered how much joy being on stage and taking on characters could make me feel. Ever since then, I have had been incredibly fortunate to have been able to work and learn from amazing casts, directors, and mentors.\nAs an actor, you can expect me to always give 100% and commit to any production or role I am given."
