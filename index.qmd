## About
4th Year Psychology and Theatre & Performance Student, University of Waterloo

## Research Interests
I am heavily interested in clinical and counselling psychology, specifically in assisting families, teenageres, and young adults through hard times.

I'm also open to not pursue a path in psychology! I have another path, and that's down theatre :)
