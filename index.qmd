## About
I am a 4th Year Psychology and Theatre & Performance Student attending the University of Waterloo. I have had the privelege to learn from many professors and mentors in both disciplines, expanding my knowledge in my passions.

## Interests
### Psychology
I am heavily interested in clinical and counselling psychology, specifically in assisting families, teenageres, and young adults through hard times.

### Not Psychology
I also have a separate plan that doesn't include psychology! It follows my other passion (and major), theatre and specifically, acting. This passion really came to fruition at the end of my high school years when I discovered how much joy being on stage and taking on characters could make me feel. Ever since then, I have had been incredibly fortunate to have been able to work and learn from amazing casts, directors, and mentors. 

As an actor, you can expect me to always give 100% and commit to any production or role I am given.
