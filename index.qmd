## About
I am a 4th Year Psychology and Theatre & Performance Student attending the University of Waterloo. I have had the privelege to learn from many professors and mentors in both disciplines, expanding my knowledge in my passions.

## Research Interests
I am heavily interested in clinical and counselling psychology, specifically in assisting families, teenageres, and young adults through hard times.

I'm also open to not pursue a path in psychology! I have another path, and that's down theatre :) 

## Selected Roles In Theatre
Oberon   [A Midsummer Night's Dream] (2025)

Curtis   [To Be Honest] (2025)

Jonathan [Vampire Musical] (2025)
