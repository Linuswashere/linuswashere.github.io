## Trying This Blogging Thing Out

Hi, this is a blog :)

### Feb 1

Semesters really do fly by. I wrote my first Psych 391 (Advanced Data Analysis) test on Wednesday, and I hope I did well. I also started to feel unwell that day, but luckily I was able to pull through. I can’t say the same though for the weekends, as at the time of writing this, hoooboy I am ridden with coughs and sniffles and a sore body. It hasn’t really been a super duper fun week because of the sickness, but oh well. Looking forward to next week! (2 tests :’c)
